<h5>Cheesy name, I know. I was on the spot when uploading the app to the server and I had to find a name which wasn't already taken. Maybe I'll change it at some point.</h5>
<h5>My motivation for building this project is to learn to build an application from end to end using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, object-relational mapping, model-view-controller architecture patterns and other concepts. I'm trying to be pretty thorough in documenting the process; check out the <a href="/news">release log</a> if you're curious. Feel free to <a href="mailto:abmorton@gmail.com">email me</a> if you have questions or would like the source code. I'm a big believer that helping others learn benefits everyone.</h5>
<h5>The goal of this project is to make a realistic stock trading game from scratch. The current feature set is pretty bare-bones, but here's where we're going...</h5>
<h4>StockHawk trading game concept:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Upon sign-up, users receive $1 million of play money which can be used to trade stocks within the game.</li>
	<li>All trades are based on actual market conditions. We track how much you've gained or lost on a particular transaction, pay dividends when applicable, etc.</li>
	<li>Game leaderboards give you bragging rights for wealthiest, most active and other categories.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Here are some features which I'm considering developing:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Smart search (not just stock symbols, but also company names.)</li>
	<li>Ability to trade on margin and short sell.</li>
	<li>Realistic capital gains/income tax liability implications for transactions.</li>
	<li>Stock graphs/charts (most likely using JavaScript.)</li>
	<li>Historical stock data lookup.</li>
	<li>Stats on the most active/best/worst-performing stocks of the day.</li>
	<li>Links to articles you might be interested in, based on the stocks you look at or own.</li>
	<li>Resources on how to learn more about the stock market and trading.</li>
	<li>Email notifications.</li>
	<li>Sign in with either username or email address and password.</li>
	<li>Possibility to sign in or create an account via Facebook or other social media.</li>
	<li>Account settings/password management.</li>
	<li>Private messaging.</li>
	<li>"Follower" relationships and other social interactions.</li>
	<li>Some decent design, including a logo.</li>
	<li>User avatars.</li>
	<li><a href="mailto:abmorton@gmail.com?subject=StockHawk feature idea">Let me know</a> if you have other ideas!</li>
</ul>
